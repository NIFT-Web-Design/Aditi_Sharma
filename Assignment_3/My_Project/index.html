  <h1>
  Tribes of Adilabad</h1>
  <p>The tribes of India constitute 8.2% of the total population. Our country has the largest number of tribes as compared to any other country. There are a variety of groups of tribes..Tribes of Adilabad hidden behind the infamous backwardness of Adilabad is a treasure trove of tribal culture waiting to be explored. The district has enormous potential for culture tourism thanks to its nearly 3.5 lakh Adivasi population, the dominant being the Gonds and Kolams, who continue to latch on to its glorious traditions.
    <br>Tribal people are a grossly misunderstood segment of society as they are considered superstitious and their poverty is often confused with lacking in culture. In reality, the way of life of the Adivasis is one of absolute consonance with nature and it is this aspect that can be seen in tribal villages in this district.</br>
